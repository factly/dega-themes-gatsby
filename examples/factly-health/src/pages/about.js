              As part of their fact-checking program, social media giant Facebook has launched a
              Global Health Fellowship to combat Health Misinformation. Factly Media & Research has
              been shortlisted among the 10 fact-checking organizations across the globe to be
              offered this fellowship. The Fellowship announcement comes at a time when the world is
              reeling under the repercussions of misinformation owing to the ongoing COVID-19
              pandemic. During the Fellowship, the selected Fellows will take part in virtual
              training sessions by third-party experts and from CrowdTangle, a social analytics
              tool. On account of being Facebookâ€™s credible Fact-checking partner, Factly aims to
              map the health misinformation landscape in India and accordingly develop methodologies
              and strategies to combat health-related misinformation in the country

              Started as an idea in 2014, it was in the mid-2010s that Factly moved into the Data
              journalism space, which was still in its nascent stages. By 2015, Factly had evolved
              from a blog to a company with an aim to transform the public information landscape by
              making data and information meaningful to people. Between 2016-18, Factly launched its
              own website and boosted the publishing of its in-house articles- this combination of
              the data stories along with YouTube videos helped Factly gain a foothold in the news
              media space through increased subscribers to its content. Today, Factly undertakes
              three broad categories of work- content production; tool-building; and consulting &
              training projects.

              In 2005, India legislated one of the best â€˜Right to Informationâ€™ laws in the world
              which changed the public information landscape and accessibility in the country. It
              was the first step towards transparency and accountability of governance. In 2012,
              India came up with the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP),
              popularly known as the â€˜Open Data policyâ€™ of the Government of India. In Spite of
              these systems in place, data and information remain in complex and overwhelming
              formats in the country. Some of the data that is meant for the public does not even
              exist in the public domain. Factly was born to create supporting platforms and
              infrastructure to bridge this gap and strengthen democracy through engagement.

                  Factlyâ€™s written and visual stories layout facts with evidence and help separate
                  the wheat from the chaff in times of hyper-connectivity and constant information
                  bombardment. The content aims to simplify public data & information that might
                  otherwise be in complex forms. The fact-checks debunk viral misinformation and lay
                  bare facts on the claims made by influencers.

                  collaborates and provides services to governments and institutions to release data
                  to the public domain. Besides these, Factly engages with various stakeholders from
                  across the â€˜Open Dataâ€™ spectrum to build successful case studies & use cases.
                  Factly also conducts training sessions on accessing, understanding & analysing
                  public data to journalists, public policy enthusiasts, NGOs etc.
