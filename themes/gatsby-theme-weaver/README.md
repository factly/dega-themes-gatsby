Read the [Source Code](https://github.com/factly/dega-themes).

## Features

- Sourcing data from Dega CMS
- Theme UI-based theming
- SEO
- Accessibility
- AMP Pages


## Prerequisites

Before installing and using themes based on the Dega CMS, you need to make sure that your system meets the following requirements:

1. Node.js Version 18 or Higher

The Dega CMS requires Node.js version 18 or higher to be installed on your system. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2. Package Manager (npm or yarn)

You also need to have a package manager installed to install the required dependencies. The recommended package managers are either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

To check if Node.js and the package manager are installed on your system, you can run the following commands in your terminal:

```
node -v

```

This will display the version of Node.js installed on your system. If you see a version number that is less than 18, you need to update your version of Node.js.

```
npm -v

```

or

```
yarn -v

```


These commands will display the version of npm or yarn installed on your system. If you don't have either of these package managers installed, you can download and install them from the [official npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn website](https://yarnpkg.com/).

Once you have Node.js and the package manager installed, you can proceed to install and use themes based on the Dega CMS.

### Shadowing

Theme shadowing in Gatsby allows you to override the default components and styles of a theme with your own custom components and styles in a themeâ€™s src directory.

Please read the guide [Shadowing in Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/) to understand how to customize the theme! Generally speaking you will want to place your files into `src/@factly/gatsby-theme-weaver/` to shadow/override files. The Theme UI config can be configured by shadowing its files in `src/gatsby-plugin-theme-ui/`.

### Editing the content

The content of the page is managed by `DegaCMS`.
